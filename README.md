The model structure follows a similar structure to conditional.py, in which the model is created through establishing priors, finding the likelihood, or probability of getting the answer correct based on each answer from each informant, then finding a compromise between the prior and likelihood through the posterior calculated in the next function before going through an analysis of the D and Z values derived from the model.
