The model structure follows a similar structure to conditional.py, in which the model is created through establishing priors, finding the likelihood, or probability of getting the answer correct based on each answer from each informant, then finding a compromise between the prior and likelihood through the posterior calculated in the next function before going through an analysis of the D and Z values derived from the model. 

As described in the comments, I decided to use a beta prior and stick with the Bernoulli distribution to set up the model and calculate the likelihood, prob. D_i, or the confidence an informant has in each of their answers, is non_discrete, and a beta prior takes into account that value and can predict an estimate between 0.5 and 1. Because an informant is still required to answer 0 or 1, the Bernoulli distribution takes into account discrete answers; for Z_j, the informants will choose either a 0 or 1 for that specific question. With these models combined, I was able to use the give formula for p to calculate the probability an informant will answer a question correct based confidence and the amount of time that question was answered correctly by other informants.
